# Taskmaster API

A Django REST Framework–based web API for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting to-do tasks. Only the authenticated owners are authorized to modify, delete and view their tasks. And only authenticated users are allowed to create tasks. The system includes user login and registration, JWT-based authentication, and a full suite of features such as pagination, filtering, search, ordering, request throttling, and API versioning. (There was one bug in this project before, that was fixed: Everybody was able see others's tasks)

## Features

- **User Auth**  
User registration and login are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) via Simple JWT, with full support for token refresh and rotation to ensure secure and seamless authentication.

- **Tasks CRUD**  
  - **Create** only if you’re authenticated. 
  - **Read** (list/detail) only if you’re the owner.
  - **Update** or **Partial Update** only if you’re the owner.  
  - **Delete** only if you’re the owner.

- **API Niceties**  
  - **Pagination**: Flexible and configurable page sizes to suit varying client needs.  
  - **Filter** & **Search**: Query your tasks by is_done, description, or any other field you’ve got.  
  - **Ordering**: Ordering: Allows clients to sort task results by specified fields, such as title, to display tasks in a desired order
  - **Throttling**: Prevents from hammering the API.  
  - **Versioning**: backward-incompatible changes require clear and structured communication.
